# yuvtools: A YUV Tool Package

This document describes yuvtools, a set of tools to manage, produce, and analyze YUV images. We have used the tools to test video paths in Portal

yuvtools includes the following tools:

* yuvconv.py: a YUV/RGB color conversor
* yuvcube.py: a tool to generate YUV/RGB cubes, i.e., the cubes that describe the output of YUV/RGB conversions
* yuvgrad.py: a tool to produce YUV gradients (which can be used to test video paths)
    * [yuvgrad: A YUV Gradient Generator](yuvgrad.md)
* yuvplot.py: a tool to parse YUV images, and produce distribution of values.
